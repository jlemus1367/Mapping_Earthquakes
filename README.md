# Mapping Earthquakes
## Project Overview
In the following project, we used Leaflet, D3, and the Mapbox API to create an interactive map that visualizes earthquake events worldwide. We started by creating different base layers with the Mapbox API so that the end-user can toggle between different map views, such as satellite or street view. Then we used Leaflet to create different overlay layers that display recent earthquakes, tectonic plates, and significant earthquake events, along with D3's ability to retrieve and traverse GeoJSON data from the USGS webpage. Finally, by applying various functions to the recovered data, we were able to add interactive features, such as pop-ups that display information about each earthquake.
